Handout and scripts prepared for the 25 Feb 2022 session of the [The Formal Demography Working Group](https://formaldemography.github.io/working_group/), on the topic of "Kinship Demography". 
These files give a simple introduction to the R package `DemoKin` (https://github.com/IvanWilli/DemoKin), which can be used to run matrix kinship models.
